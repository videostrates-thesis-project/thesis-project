## Introduction
```
Hello! I'm an AI assistant designed to help you with video editing tasks. 
I can:
	- add or edit clips and other elements,
	- modify HTML code of custom elements, 
	- generate images
	- access the library of reusable elements and the current playhead position
	- see what is currently selected in the library, the timeline or the chat. The selection will be marked with magical sparkles!
  
Unfortunately, I don't have access to searching in clips transcript yet.
  
Feel free to ask me anything!
```

## Task 1 - Formula 1
In the first task, you should create a short highlight video for the start of a Formula 1 race.
- Add the "F1 highlights" clip to the timeline.
- Add the “F1 onboard” clip as well - it should be small, in the bottom right corner and start around second 3
- Add a black box with rounded edges on the top left, which says “Formula 1“, then “Lap 1/56” below it. It should start at second 1 and last until the end of the video and slide in from the left when it appears on the screen.

## Task 2 - Baby elephant news
In the local zoo, four cute baby elephants were born this year. Your task is to cut a short news report that introduces them.
### Scene 1
The first scene should contain the news reporter talking. While doing so, a generated image of a cute baby elephant should float in from the right as an illustration. The image should be cropped to it's center with a 1:1 aspect ratio.

### Scene 2
In the second scene the 4 baby elephants should be shown one after another. The clips for each elephants should be cut sequentially. Over each clip, add a banner on the bottom with two rows of text. The first row of the banner should contain the name of the elephant with large font size, while the second row should contain sliding text from right to left containing a description about the elephant.

The elephant's names and their short description:
- Daisy: Daisy loves spending her time at the local spa.
- Cosmo: Cosmo is a true sportsman. His speed and endurance is going to get him to the world cup one day.
- Sandra: Sandra's obsession with fountains just makes her more adorable.
- Louis: For Louis there's no greater joy than having a good nap. Anytime. Anywhere.

`Hint`: Once the first banner is created try to add it to the library as a reusable element so that it can be imported and modified for the rest of the elephants.

## Task 3 - iPhone colors
You have three Apple conference recordings from different years. Additionally, in the custom elements tab, there are predefined title screens that can be reused. Their content can be changed after adding them to the timeline.
Your task is to create a video showing iPhone colors over time. 
- The video should start with a logo, then a title screen 
- For each conference add a cropped clip when new non-pro iPhone colors are introduced. 
	- `Hint`: search for "colors" and look at the contextual information around matched results
- Every clip presenting different colors should be preceded with a separate title screen providing information such as conference year. 
- Every clip should start with a fade-in transition.

## Bonus task - Minecraft Cinematic

This task is an open-ended exploratory task. The goal is to release your imagination, use all the experience that you have gathered so far, and create something cool.

In the library you can find images and clips taken in Minecraft, and your task is to cut a fancy cinematic video showcasing how beautiful this video game is. The resources have two main categories: city and nature.

Some tips about what you could do:
- Cut similar clips sequentially, like "close city street clips"
- Make compositions of the clips and images, like grid, vertical split, picture in picture
- Add animations: fade-in, slide-in, zoom-in, spinning, jumping, stretching
- Create custom elements, like title screen, banner, logo
- Generate extra images
